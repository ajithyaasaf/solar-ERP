## What Solar Companies Actually Use Today

### 📊 The Honest Comparison

**Reality:** There is NO other affordable solar-specific field management software in India. Here's what solar companies currently use:

| Solution Type | Monthly Cost | What You Get | What's Missing | Best For |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Manual Methods (Excel/WhatsApp/Paper)** | ₹0 | Basic tracking | Everything automated, professional, GPS proof, photo documentation | Very small teams willing to spend hours on admin |
| **Generic HR Software (Zoho/Keka/GreytHR)** | ₹8,000-12,000 | Attendance, payroll, basic HR | Site visit management, GPS tracking with photos, solar-specific features, quotations | Large companies with big budgets, not field-focused |
| **Custom Development** | ₹5-10 lakhs one-time | Exactly what you want (if done right) | Huge upfront cost, 6-12 months wait, maintenance headaches | Enterprises with ₹50L+ annual revenue |
| **Our Platform** | ₹2,999 | Complete field operations + business management | Nothing - it's all included | Solar companies of any size wanting professional solution now |

### 🎯 Why We're Different

**We're Not Competing With Zoho/Keka/GreytHR** - They're generic HR software for office workers. We're built specifically for solar field operations.

**What Makes Us Unique:**

1. **Solar-Specific Features:**
   - Panel configurations (250W to 550W)
   - Subsidy calculations (PM Surya Ghar)
   - EB process tracking
   - Bank documentation management
   - Solar system quotations

2. **Field Operations Focus:**
   - GPS-tracked site visits (they have basic attendance only)
   - Photo documentation with overlays (they don't have this)
   - Multi-department workflows: Technical/Marketing/Admin (they're generic)
   - Follow-up management for solar leads (they don't track this)

3. **All-in-One Platform:**
   - Attendance + Site Visits + Payroll + Quotations + Invoices
   - Other companies need 3-4 different software for this
   - You get everything for ₹2,999/month

4. **Built for India:**
   - Bangalore server (fast for Indian users)
   - Indian support team
   - Understands Indian solar industry workflow
   - EPF/ESI/PT compliance built-in

**The Truth:** If you use Zoho People (₹8,000/mo) + a CRM (₹5,000/mo) + accounting software (₹3,000/mo), you'll spend ₹16,000/month and STILL won't have proper site visit management with GPS photos.

**We give you everything for ₹2,999/month.**
