Final Update Instructions for Site Visit Form – Project Type Section Please review and implement the following updates. These changes apply primarily to Off Grid and Hybrid project types, with minor adjustments for other types like Solar Water Pump and Solar Water Heater. 🖼️ Image Breakdown Summary Image 1 – Full Page Overview This is the complete layout of the Off Grid project type page. All existing logic is correct and already implemented. Image 2 – Dynamic Description All calculations are already implemented. Only the description text should be dynamic based on selected values. Image 3 – Battery AH and DC Volt Columns Add a new column Batt. AH: This should reflect the Battery AH selected during project configuration in quotation creation. Add a new column DC Volt: Calculated as: Battery Volt × Battery Quantity = DC Volt Image 4 – Inverter Volt and Battery Row All other logic remains unchanged. Use the Inverter Volt value entered in project configuration (new field added for Off Grid and Hybrid). Add a new row Battery: This may also apply to other project types—please verify and ensure consistency. In the Rating column: Use KVA for inverter rating (specific to Off Grid and Hybrid). Use AH for battery rating. Image 5 – Backup Calculation Table Add a new table below the BOM section with two constant labels: During Fully Charged Condition With Efficiency of 80% Backup Watts Calculation: Assume 1 AH = 10 Watts Example: Battery AH = 100 → 100 × 10 = 1000 Battery Qty = 2 → 1000 × 2 = 2000 Subtract 3% loss → 2000 - 3% = 1940 This final value should be editable. Usage Watts Row: Manual input required. Allow up to 5 columns (expandable if needed). Backup Hours Row: Automatically calculated as: Backup Watts ÷ Usage Watts All columns should be filled based on this formula. ✅ These changes apply to both Off Grid and Hybrid. Existing logic is correct—only enhancements are needed. Implementation Standards Use modular, reusable components for dynamic field rendering. Apply clean separation of concerns: UI, logic, and data binding. Maintain backward compatibility and avoid breaking existing logic.
