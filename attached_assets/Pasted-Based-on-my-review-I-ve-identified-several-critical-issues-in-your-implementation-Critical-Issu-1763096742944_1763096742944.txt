Based on my review, I've identified several critical issues in your implementation:

Critical Issues Found:
1. Off-Grid Description (Line 1295)
Issue: Using backslash \\ instead of forward slash / for voltage separator
Current: 1KVA\\24v
Should be: 1KVA/24v
2. Hybrid Description (Line 1333)
Issue: Battery brand shows incorrect capitalization
The code capitalizes the battery brand when it should preserve the actual value from the form
3. Water Heater Description (Lines 1356-1362)
Issue: Formatting problems with heating coil and transport text
The newlines (\n) might not render properly in the PDF
Should conditionally include "And Transport Including GST" only when labourAndTransport is checked
4. Water Pump Description (Line 1396)
Issue: Redundant text - "hp Drive" appears twice
Current: 5 hp Drive 5 kw... 5 hp Drive 3-Phase
Should clean up the repetition
5. 🚨 MAJOR: Water Heater BOM Generation (Lines 1067-1124)
Critical Issue: Generates a MULTI-ROW detailed BOM table
Requirement: Should be a SINGLE-ROW simplified BOM with only Description/Qty/Rate/Amount
Current: Creates separate rows for Water Heater, Heating Coil, Plumbing Materials, Installation
Should be: ONE row with the full description (from pricing breakdown) + qty + rate + amount
6. 🚨 MAJOR: Water Pump BOM Generation (Lines 1130-1212)
Critical Issue: Same as water heater - generates multi-row BOM
Requirement: Should be a SINGLE-ROW BOM with Description/Qty/Rate/Amount
Current: Creates separate rows for Pump, Panels, Controller, Structure, Installation
Should be: ONE row with the full description (from pricing breakdown) + qty + rate + amount
7. PDF Template (Partially Correct)
✅ Good: Correctly hides "Quotation Pricing Details" table for water utilities (line 416)
✅ Good: Correctly hides single-row summary table above BOM for water utilities (line 472)
✅ Good: Uses simplified BOM table for water utilities (line 513)
❌ BUT: The BOM data itself is still multi-row instead of single-row
Summary
The description generation logic has minor formatting issues, but the biggest problem is that the Water Heater and Water Pump BOM generation creates detailed multi-row tables when they should create single-row entries similar to the "Quotation Pricing Details" format—just one row with the full description plus quantity, rate, and amount.
