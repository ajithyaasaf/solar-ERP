In the quotation template for BOM, we use a lot of mocked data which is completely incorrect.
Actually, we have two sources to prepare a quotation: one is manual entry, and the other is from a site visit.
Both are essentially the same—only the way details are filled differs. In the "From Site Visit" option, partial details are fetched from the actual site visit, which is now working. You can see this in the application.
Now, for BOM, we should calculate the quotation details properly. I’ll explain with an example image how the values are derived so you get a clear idea.
In the image, there are two parts shown. First: "Quotation for 3 kW Ongrid Solar Power Generation System" The "3 kW" value is calculated as follows:
Panel watts × Total panel count For example, if the total is 3120 watts, then we take the first digit as 3 kW.
Next, if the user selects a project value of ₹2,15,000.00, we need to split and use it in the table titled "Quotation for 3 kW Ongrid Solar Power Generation System."
Example: Total amount is ₹2,15,000.00 (including GST)
Step 1: Calculate Base Price (Before GST) Rate per kW × Number of kW = Base Price ₹65,809.61 × 3 ≈ ₹197,428.83 ≈ ₹1,97,429 ✅ This matches the base price in the summary.
Step 2: Calculate GST GST per kW × Number of kW = Total GST ₹5,857 × 3 = ₹17,571
Or using the percentage formula: GST = Base Price × 8.9% = ₹197,429 × 0.089 ≈ ₹17,571 ✅ Matches the GST in the summary.
Step 3: Calculate Total Price Total Price = Base Price + GST = ₹1,97,429 + ₹17,571 ≈ ₹2,15,000
Step 4: GST per kW GST per kW = Total GST ÷ kW = ₹17,571 ÷ 3 ≈ ₹5,857 ✅ Conclusion:
•	Rate per kW × Quantity = Base Price
•	Base Price × GST % = Total GST
•	GST per kW = Total GST ÷ Quantity
•	Total Price = Base Price + Total GST
Everything matches perfectly.
We should also implement flexible GST entry in this quotation preparation.
BOM Section
Total Amount ₹2,15,000 – Subsidy Amount ₹78,000 = ₹1,37,000
Most importantly, subsidy applies only if the project type is residential.
•	For 1 kW: ₹30,000
•	For 2 kW: ₹60,000
•	For 3–10 kW: ₹78,000
•	Above 10 kW: No subsidy
BOM Table
Phase Inverter-KW Panel Watts 1 3 3240
•	"1" comes from the phase selected during site visit (single or three-phase)—this is dynamic.
•	"3" is the inverter kW selected.
•	"3240" is calculated as panel watts × total panel count.
