There is already a dummy quotation creation page at /quotation/new, but it has no functionality yet.
I want you to upgrade this into a fully functional quotation creation page based on the following requirements:

1. Data Sources

There are three site visit forms, each belonging to a different department.

Each form collects different types of data.

All data collected during site visits must be used to create a quotation.

2. Quotation Page Functionality

/quotation → shows the list of created quotations.

/quotation/new → should be the quotation creation page.

The quotation creation page must support two workflows:

Create a new quotation from scratch.

Select an existing customer → automatically fetch data from their site visit forms → populate the quotation page.

Partial Data Handling:

If a user’s site visit forms are only partially filled, the system must:

Auto-fill whatever data exists.

Clearly show which fields are missing.

Allow manual entry of the missing fields before generating the quotation.

This applies to all three site visit forms.

Additional Fields:

The reference document (attached_assets/Q-1052 Mr.P.S.Pradeep 3kw Ongrid 3 Phase_1758697262729.docx) contains some fields that are not collected in the site visit forms.

These fields must also be available on the quotation creation page so that the final quotation matches what the company currently prepares manually.

3. UI/UX Requirements

Plan this as a senior UI/UX developer.

The /quotation/new page should be:

Flexible → supports both new and existing customer flows.

Intuitive → highlight missing fields for manual completion.

Modular → easy to extend if new forms or fields are added later.

The quotation form should allow both:

Automatic population of existing data.

Manual input for corrections or missing information.

4. Deliverable

File Name: new_changes.txt (in the root directory).

Content:

A detailed plan/analysis for upgrading the dummy /quotation/new page.

Must include:

Data mapping (site visit forms → quotation fields).

Workflow (new vs. existing customer, partial data handling).

UI/UX design considerations.

Handling of extra fields from the reference document.

Do not implement yet. Only produce the detailed planning document.

This feature is critical for the application. Plan very carefully and ensure nothing is missed in the flow.
