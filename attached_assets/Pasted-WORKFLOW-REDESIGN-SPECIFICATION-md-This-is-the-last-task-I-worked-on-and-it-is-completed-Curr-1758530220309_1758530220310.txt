This is the last task I worked on and it is completed.  
Currently, when a customer (for example "A") is converted to a customer, he moves to the **Completed** tab.  

But now I have a question:  
When I make a **follow-up** for him, where should it show?  
Because this is not currently implemented.  

When I make a **follow-up** for someone who is already in the **Customer tab** (already converted during a normal site visit checkout),  
where should it show?  

If I start a follow-up for a person who is already in the **Completed tab**,  
how should we handle this?  
I mean:  
- The follow-up for this person should show in the **On Process** tab.  
- What happens after the follow-up is completed?  
- Does the follow-up automatically move from the **On Process** tab to the respective tab based on the final outcome selected during follow-up checkout?  

Because in checkout we currently ask for:  
- **On Process**  
- **Converted**  
- **Cancelled**  

Since this customer is already in the customer list, during a **follow-up checkout** it should instead ask:  
- **Completed**  
- **On Process**  
- **Cancelled**  

This is more meaningful, because:  
- In the **normal site visit checkout** we give options: Converted, On Process, Cancelled.  
- In the **follow-up checkout** we should give options: Completed, On Process, Cancelled.  

Another doubt is:  
This customer was already converted during the normal site visit, so he is in the **Completed tab**.  
When I go to the Completed tab and start a follow-up for this customer:  
- He should show in the **On Process tab** while the follow-up is active.  
- After the follow-up visit is completed, he should move to the **visit timeline** of that customer and then to the respective tab based on the outcome chosen:  
  - If **Completed**, he goes back to the Completed tab.  
  - If **On Process**, he stays in On Process because the follow-up process still requires more time/work.  
  - If **Cancelled**, then the customer (with all his data) moves to the **Cancelled tab**.  

I don’t need a complex solution, but I do need a solid one.  

So here are the cases:  

1. A person is already converted, and I start a follow-up.  
   - It moves to the **On Process** tab when I complete the site visit.  

2. What happens if I select **On Process** again during the follow-up?  

3. What happens if I click **Converted**, since he is already converted?  

4. What happens if I click **Cancelled**?  
   - Will the already converted customer move to the **Cancelled** tab because I clicked cancelled during follow-up?
