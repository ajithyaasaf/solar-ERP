In the application There is quotation making proces everything was good creation process every calculation and quoatiaon tempalte also Good

Need small corrections

for examble there is a five project types ongrid,offgrid,hybrid,water pump,water heater


i tell you exactly in which place i need this change

 i  need some change in on grid off grid , hybrid,water heater ,water pump whcih in the "Pricing and payment terms"  step there is "Quotation Pricing Details" table in this the description is auto genrated here i need some changes for examble 

 in ongrid
 Description now dynamically get system and installation of kw which is good but i also need 3 KW Inverter in some project type it is inverter kva next phase liek single phase or three phase and continues



 in offgrid 
 
see the 1st image 
that 340W is comes from  based from panel watts 
we choose that * 2 this two is based on no of panel we choose
and  1KVA\24v int his 1kva is what we choose as a inverter kva in form and 24v in the autocalculated value of inverter volt you can se in the BOM table we have formula for this  or else there is field in the project types waht value user type in that you can them here

next that 1PH is no needed next MPPT is what we choose type in inverter make
next 100AH X 2 in this the 100Ah is what we choose as Battery AH in the form and 2 is battery count 

1-phase is automatically comes from form this phases automatically changed in the form based on inverter KW or inverter kva


in hybrid
see the second image
10KW panel asualsual this is from  what panel watts we selected 
10kv this is inverter kva /120 v is inverter volt 
3 phase also comes from form 
UTL is Battery Brand value
200ah is battery AH 
Lead acid batter comes from what we choose in Battery Type
10Nos is what we choose in Battery count 


in water heater 
see the 3rd image

in this image you can see image column don’t care about that we are only discussed about description 

in description the 
“supply and insatallation (Water Heater Brand) make solar water heater (capacity litre)commercial (pressurized or no pressurized should be based on the field Water heater model ) with corrosion resistant epoxy Coated Inner tank and powder coated outer tank (Heating coil will be based on Heating Coil Type field in the form ) And Transport Including GST

then there is imp implementation need new field qty,and water heater model,and add check box Labour and Transport 
 is required here
complete implementation required for this new fields
while make change in this new field change you need to also make change in the stie visit marketing form prject type water heater then you need to make some change in the site visit details modal

in water pump 
see the 
fourth image
System include : (based on what we choose in the form in Motor HP field)
5kw this is panel watts * panel count then take the first value and use here same formula is used on ongrid project type in one place you can check that for reference next 540Wp this is based on panel watts selection * 10 is panel count UTL panel is based on panel brand field
5hp drive is based on Motor Hp field

then 3phase is what they selected in the form what phase they are selected , 5kw is based on same panel watts * panel count formula

structre 3 feet and 4 feet… this is dynamic from form 

next all are dynamic based on check boxes


you need to make a change change the Motor Hp field name to Drive Hp 
next you need to add in the project type for check box,lightening arrest, Electrical Accessories, Earth Connection(same like in on grid project type ),new check box Labour and Transport
also you need to look into site visit marketing form and site visit details modal based on this all changes



__________________________________________________________________________

Prompt:
In the application, there is a quotation-making process. Everything is good — the creation process, all calculations, and the quotation template are working correctly.
I need some small corrections.
There are five project types: On-Grid, Off-Grid, Hybrid, Water Pump, and Water Heater.
I will tell you exactly where I need these changes.
I need some changes in On-Grid, Off-Grid, Hybrid, Water Heater, and Water Pump, specifically in the "Pricing and Payment Terms" step.
In this step, there is a "Quotation Pricing Details" table where the Description is auto-generated.
Here, I need the following changes:
________________________________________
1. On-Grid
The description now dynamically gets the system and installation of kW, which is good.
But I also need to include 3 KW Inverter (in some project types it is inverter KVA) and then the next phase (like single phase or three phase) should continue accordingly.
________________________________________
2. Off-Grid
(Refer to the 1st image)
•	The 340W comes from the selected Panel Watts.
•	Multiply it by 2 (this 2 is based on the number of panels selected).
•	1KVA/24V → here, 1KVA is the selected Inverter KVA in the form, and 24V is the auto-calculated value of Inverter Volt.
You can see this formula in the BOM table. If not, there is a field in the project type where the user enters this value — you can fetch it from there.
•	The 1PH is not needed.
•	MPPT is based on the selected Inverter Make.
•	100AH X 2 → here, 100AH is the selected Battery AH in the form, and 2 is the Battery Count.
•	1-phase should come automatically from the form. The phase changes dynamically based on the selected Inverter KW or Inverter KVA which is already implemented in the project type form.
________________________________________
3. Hybrid
(Refer to the 2nd image)
•	10KW panel → comes from the selected Panel Watts.
•	10KVA/120V → Inverter KVA and Inverter Volt.
•	3 phase → comes from the form.
•	UTL → this is the Battery Brand value.
•	200AH → this is the Battery AH value.
•	Lead Acid Battery → comes from the selected Battery Type.
•	10 Nos → comes from the selected Battery Count.

4. Water Heater
(Refer to the 3rd image)
Ignore the image column — we are only discussing the description.
In the description, it should display as:
“Supply and installation of (Water Heater Brand) make solar water heater (Capacity in Litres) commercial (Pressurized or Non-Pressurized based on the field Water Heater Model) with corrosion-resistant epoxy-coated inner tank and powder-coated outer tank (Heating coil will be based on Heating Coil Type field in the form) and Transport Including GST.”
Then, implement the following new fields:
•	Qty
•	Water Heater Model (Pressurized or Non-Pressurized two options to choose)
•	Labour and Transport (Checkbox)
Complete implementation is required for these new fields.
When making these field changes, also make changes in But Before making an changes in the site visit form and d:
•	The Site Visit Marketing Form (Project Type: Water Heater)
•	The Site Visit Details Modal

Additonally(for water heater) : in the pdf template generation normally for the all the project types we “Quotation Pricing Details” table but here now we don’t need that table and also above the BOM table we have one table single row table this is also we don’t need for this project type Next in the BOM table Normally we have lot calculation base on many things But in this water heater we don’t need that for examble see the image I attached as the 5th image just a BOM table with columns SlNo,Image (no needed),Decription,Price,Qty,Amount like in the image this is enough also after that so calculation this is enough so in the Quotation creation process “Pricing & Terms” step we have to make this changes to replicate in pdf template also I say the next changes also that need afte the table “Quotation Pricing Details” in the “Pricing & Terms” step  we only don’t need “Warranty details part”  then “Delivery period” part in the final step “Quotation summary part no needed” also “Document required for pm surya ghar” part also no needed” in this step we have editable Bom table I hope you know what changes you have to make here based on we discussed after Bom table should mention “installation on Floor(dynamic comes from what we select in the project type form ) .

5. Water Pump
(Refer to the 4th image)
Description logic:
•	System include: (based on what is chosen in the Motor HP field in the form)
•	5KW → calculated as Panel Watts × Panel Count, take the first value and use it here. (The same formula is already used in the On-Grid project type — check that for reference.)
•	540Wp → based on Panel Watts selection × 10 (Panel Count).
•	UTL Panel → comes from Panel Brand field.
•	5HP Drive → comes from Motor HP field.
•	3 Phase → comes from the phase selected in the form.
•	5KW → based on the same Panel Watts × Panel Count formula.
•	Structure 3 feet and 4 feet → dynamic values from the form.
•	The remaining items are also dynamic based on selected checkboxes.
Additional changes:
•	Rename the Motor HP field to Drive HP in this project tyoe. 
•	In the project type form, add checkboxes for:
o	Lightening Arrest
o	Electrical Accessories
o	Earth Connection (same as in On-Grid project type)
o	Labour and Transport
•	Also, update these canges in Site Visit Marketing Form water pump project type also and Site Visit Details Modal to reflect these changes.



Additonally(for water Pump : in the pdf template generation normally for the all the project types we “Quotation Pricing Details” table but here now we don’t need that table and also above the BOM table we have one table single row table this is also we don’t need for this project type Next in the BOM table Normally we have lot calculation base on many things But in this water heater we don’t need that for examble see the image I attached as the 6th image just a BOM table with columns SlNo,Decription,Price,Qty,Amount like in the image this is enough also after that so calculation this is enough so in the Quotation creation process “Pricing & Terms” step we have to make this changes to replicate in pdf template also I say the next changes also that need afte the table “Quotation Pricing Details” in the “Pricing & Terms” step we only don’t need “Warranty details part”  then “Delivery period” part in the final step “Quotation summary part no needed” also “Document required for pm surya ghar” part also no needed” in this step we have editable Bom table I hope you know what changes you have to make here based on we discussed .
