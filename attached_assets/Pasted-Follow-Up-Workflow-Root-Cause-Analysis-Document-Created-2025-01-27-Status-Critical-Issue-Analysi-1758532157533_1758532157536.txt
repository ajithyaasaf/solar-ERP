Follow-Up Workflow Root Cause Analysis

Status: Critical Issue Analysis
Priority: High - Business Process Gap


🚨 PROBLEM STATEMENT
The current site visit management system has a critical gap in follow-up workflow handling for customers who have already been converted. The system lacks clear business logic for managing customer status transitions when follow-ups are created for customers in different completion states.


🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Primary Issue: Follow-Up Workflow Logic Gap
Current System Understanding:

Regular site visits flow: in_progress → checkout → completed + visitOutcome (converted/on_process/cancelled)
Customers are conceptually organized into tabs based on visitOutcome:Completed Tab: visitOutcome = "converted"
On Process Tab: visitOutcome = "on_process"
Cancelled Tab: visitOutcome = "cancelled"
Critical Gap Identified: When a customer who is already converted (in Completed tab) requires a follow-up, the system has NO DEFINED WORKFLOW for:

Where the customer should appear during the follow-up process
What checkout options should be presented during follow-up completion
How different follow-up outcomes should affect the customer's final status

📋 DETAILED PROBLEM BREAKDOWN
Problem 1: Semantic Inconsistency in Follow-Up Checkout
Current Implementation:

// Regular Site Visit Checkout Options
visitOutcomes = ["converted", "on_process", "cancelled"]
 
// Follow-Up Checkout - SAME OPTIONS (WRONG!)
// For an already converted customer, "converted" doesn't make sense
 
Issue: When completing a follow-up for an already converted customer, offering "converted" as an option is semantically incorrect and confusing.

Problem 2: Undefined Customer Status During Follow-Up
Scenario:

Customer A is converted → moves to Completed Tab
User starts follow-up for Customer A
QUESTION: Where should Customer A appear while the follow-up is active?
Current System Gap:

No logic exists to temporarily move the customer to On Process Tab during follow-up
No clear indication that a follow-up is in progress for a completed customer
Problem 3: Ambiguous Post-Follow-Up Status Transitions
Scenario Flow:

Customer A (Converted) → Follow-Up Started → ??? → Follow-Up Completed → ???
 
Undefined Cases:

Follow-up outcome: "Completed" → Should return to Completed tab
Follow-up outcome: "On Process" → Should stay in On Process tab (more work needed)
Follow-up outcome: "Cancelled" → Should this cancel the entire customer relationship?
Problem 4: Business Logic Contradiction
Current System Assumption:

Once converted = permanently in Completed tab
Follow-ups are separate entities
Business Reality:

Converted customers may need ongoing service
Follow-up outcomes can change the customer's current status
Need dynamic status management based on latest follow-up results

🛠️ WHAT I UNDERSTAND
Current Architecture Analysis
Data Models (shared/schema.ts)
// Site Visit Schema
status: "in_progress" | "completed" | "cancelled"
visitOutcome: "converted" | "on_process" | "cancelled"
scheduledFollowUpDate?: Date
 
// Follow-Up Schema
followUpReason: string
description: string
originalVisitId: string // Links back to original visit
 
Service Layer
SiteVisitService: Handles regular site visits
FollowUpService: Handles follow-up creation/management
Both services operate independently with minimal cross-communication
Frontend Components
SiteVisitStartModal: Creates new visits with visitOutcome = "on_process"
SiteVisitCheckoutModal: Allows outcome selection during checkout
FollowUpModal: Creates follow-ups but doesn't handle status transitions
Key Architecture Insights
Separation of Concerns: Site visits and follow-ups are treated as separate entities
Status vs Outcome: System has both status (technical) and visitOutcome (business)
No Cross-Entity Logic: Follow-ups don't affect original visit status
Tab Organization: Based on visitOutcome but not dynamically managed

🎯 WHAT SHOULD WE DO
Solution Strategy: Dynamic Status Management
Core Principle
Implement a customer-centric status system that dynamically updates based on the latest business activity (including follow-ups).

Proposed Workflow Logic
Scenario 1: Converted Customer Follow-Up
1. Customer A (Converted) → In Completed Tab
2. Start Follow-Up → Customer A moves to On Process Tab
3. Complete Follow-Up with outcome:
- "Completed" → Return to Completed Tab
- "On Process" → Stay in On Process Tab
- "Cancelled" → Move to Cancelled Tab
 
Scenario 2: Follow-Up Checkout Options
// Context-Aware Checkout Options
if (isFollowUpCheckout && originalCustomerStatus === 'converted') {
checkoutOptions = ["completed", "on_process", "cancelled"]
// "Completed" instead of "Converted" (semantically correct)
} else {
checkoutOptions = ["converted", "on_process", "cancelled"]
// Regular checkout options
}
 

📝 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement
1.1 Extend Site Visit Schema
// Add customer-level status tracking
customerCurrentStatus: "converted" | "on_process" | "cancelled"
lastActivityType: "initial_visit" | "follow_up"
lastActivityDate: Date
activeFollowUpId?: string // Reference to active follow-up
 
1.2 Extend Follow-Up Schema
// Add business impact fields
affectsCustomerStatus: boolean // Whether this follow-up changes customer status
originalCustomerStatus: string // Customer status before follow-up
newCustomerStatus?: string // Customer status after follow-up completion
 
Phase 2: Business Logic Implementation
2.1 Follow-Up Creation Logic
async createFollowUp(originalVisitId: string, followUpData: any) {
// 1. Get original visit and customer status
const originalVisit = await this.getSiteVisitById(originalVisitId)
const currentCustomerStatus = originalVisit.visitOutcome
 
// 2. Create follow-up with context
const followUp = await this.followUpService.createFollowUp({
...followUpData,
originalCustomerStatus: currentCustomerStatus,
affectsCustomerStatus: true
})
 
// 3. Update original visit to reflect active follow-up
await this.updateSiteVisit(originalVisitId, {
customerCurrentStatus: "on_process", // Temporary status during follow-up
activeFollowUpId: followUp.id,
lastActivityType: "follow_up",
lastActivityDate: new Date()
})
 
return followUp
}
 
2.2 Follow-Up Checkout Logic
async completeFollowUp(followUpId: string, outcome: string) {
const followUp = await this.getFollowUpById(followUpId)
const originalVisit = await this.getSiteVisitById(followUp.originalVisitId)
 
// Map follow-up outcome to customer status
let newCustomerStatus: string
switch(outcome) {
case "completed":
newCustomerStatus = "converted"
break
case "on_process":
newCustomerStatus = "on_process"
break
case "cancelled":
newCustomerStatus = "cancelled"
break
}
 
// Update original visit with final status
await this.updateSiteVisit(followUp.originalVisitId, {
customerCurrentStatus: newCustomerStatus,
activeFollowUpId: null, // Clear active follow-up
lastActivityType: "follow_up",
lastActivityDate: new Date()
})
 
// Update follow-up record
await this.updateFollowUp(followUpId, {
status: "completed",
newCustomerStatus,
completedAt: new Date()
})
}
 
Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
3.1 Context-Aware Checkout Modal
// SiteVisitCheckoutModal.tsx
const getCheckoutOptions = (siteVisit: SiteVisit) => {
if (siteVisit.isFollowUp && siteVisit.originalCustomerStatus === 'converted') {
return [
{ value: "completed", label: "Completed" },
{ value: "on_process", label: "On Process" },
{ value: "cancelled", label: "Cancelled" }
]
}
 
return [
{ value: "converted", label: "Converted" },
{ value: "on_process", label: "On Process" },
{ value: "cancelled", label: "Cancelled" }
]
}
 
3.2 Dynamic Tab Filtering
// site-visit.tsx
const getVisitsByOutcome = (visits: SiteVisit[]) => {
return {
completed: visits.filter(v => v.customerCurrentStatus === 'converted'),
onProcess: visits.filter(v => v.customerCurrentStatus === 'on_process'),
cancelled: visits.filter(v => v.customerCurrentStatus === 'cancelled')
}
}
 
Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements
4.1 Status Indicators
Add "Follow-up in Progress" badges for customers with active follow-ups
Show latest activity timestamp on customer cards
Highlight customers with overdue follow-ups
4.2 Timeline Integration
Enhanced customer visit timeline showing status transitions
Clear indication of follow-up impacts on customer status
Activity log showing all status changes with timestamps

MY ANSWER:

Thanks, this is an excellent breakdown. A few clarifications before you start implementing:

Please focus only on the follow-up workflow redesign. Do not make changes to the site visit monitoring page in this phase.
For checkout outcomes:

Normal checkout → ["converted", "on_process", "cancelled"]
Follow-up checkout → ["completed", "on_process", "cancelled"]
“Completed” should map back to the Converted tab, but I want to confirm: do we need to store it as “completed” or just map it back to “converted”? I prefer clarity in the data model.
Schema changes: I like your proposal, but let’s keep it minimal. Only add fields if absolutely necessary.
Timeline: Just ensure follow-up outcomes are logged in the customer’s visit history. No need for badges/overdue highlighting yet.
With this, let’s proceed to Step 1: Schema & API updates first.
