Current Workflow (Complex & Automatic)
User Experience:
1.	User checks in → System automatically starts tracking time
2.	User works → System silently calculates if they're going into OT based on department rules
3.	User checks out → System automatically adds OT hours if they worked past department time
4.	Problem: User has no control and doesn't know when OT started
Issues with Current System:
•	❌ No user control - OT happens automatically
•	❌ Confusing - Users don't know when they entered OT
•	❌ Department dependent - Complex timing rules determine OT
•	❌ No explicit consent - OT gets added without user knowing
•	❌ Hard to dispute - No clear OT start/end evidence
New Manual OT Workflow (Simple & Clear)
User Experience:
1.	Regular Work Day:
•	Check In → Work → Check Out (same as before)
2.	When OT is Needed:
•	Click "Start OT" → Take selfie → Work extra hours
•	Click "End OT" → Take selfie → Done!
Benefits of New System:
•	✅ Crystal clear - User explicitly chooses when to do OT
•	✅ Simple buttons - Just "Start OT" and "End OT"
•	✅ Visual evidence - Photos prove OT start and end
•	✅ Location proof - Auto-captured location for both OT actions
•	✅ User control - No surprise OT calculations
•	✅ Easy to understand - Even non-technical users get it immediately
Side-by-Side Comparison
Aspect	Current (Auto)	New (Manual)
User Control	None - automatic	Full - user decides
Clarity	Confusing rules	Clear buttons
Evidence	Only check-in/out photos	Photos for OT start/end too
Disputes	Hard to verify	Clear photo + location proof
Learning Curve	Need to understand department timing	Just click OT buttons
Flexibility	Rigid department rules	Work OT anytime needed
Real Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: Emergency Work
•	Old Way: User works late → System may/may not count as OT depending on department rules → Confusion
•	New Way: User clicks "Start OT" → Works → Clicks "End OT" → Clear OT record with photos
Scenario 2: Early Morning Work
•	Old Way: User comes early → Complex calculation if it counts as OT → No clear evidence
•	New Way: User clicks "Start OT" before regular hours → Clear record with selfie and location
Scenario 3: Weekend Work
•	Old Way: Department rules might not handle weekends properly → Confusion
•	New Way: User clicks "Start OT" → Works → Clicks "End OT" → Simple and clear
Why New Workflow is Much Easier
1.	No Mental Math: Users don't need to calculate department timing rules
2.	Explicit Actions: Every OT session requires deliberate user action
3.	Visual Feedback: Users see exactly when OT starts and ends
4.	Proof of Work: Photo evidence makes disputes rare
5.	Works Anywhere: Location auto-capture means no manual address entry
The new workflow transforms OT from a complex, automatic calculation into two simple button clicks. This is much easier for users to understand and use!
